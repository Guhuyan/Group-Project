# Game Database Project

Are you looking to get more information on a video game? If you are, then you've come to the right place!

Our project this time pulls from the [Game Database API](https://api-docs.igdb.com/#about). We use it to pull the video game images, rating, game summary, and titles. All the user has to do is enter the name of a game that they would like more information on, and our app would then display a list of games related to their search.

## Getting Started

Since this project only use HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and AJAX - there is no special instructions on getting a development env running. Simply clone the repo and use an editor like Visual Studio to render the project.

A live project can be found [HERE](https://guhuyan.github.io/Group-Project/) on my github page.
